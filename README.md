# Hi, I’m Jinho 👋
**EE @ UofT | Semiconductors · Computer Hardware · Control Systems**

I build reliable systems that bridge theory and hardware from digital logic and DSP on FPGAs to robust control implementations. Alongside my core engineering work, I explore web platforms and AI as side projects to prototype ideas and deliver practical tools.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
### AI-Powered Roommate Matching Platform  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-black?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/junejinho620/sharespace_project)  
> SBERT-based roommate matching with JWT authentication and real-time messaging. A side project exploring AI-driven social matching and web design.  
**Tech:** `Node.js` · `Express` · `MySQL` · `Socket.IO` · `SBERT`  
**Impact:**  
> - Designed onboarding flows and analytics hooks for product iteration.  


### Subsystem B - Digital Demodulator
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-black?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/junejinho620/digital-demodulator/tree/main)  
> FPGA demodulator that takes I/Q signals around a low-IF, performs AM/SSB detection, and streams line-level audio over I²S.    
**Tech:** `Verilog/SystemVerilog` · `Quartus` · `ModelSim`       
**Impact:**  
> - Implemented fixed-point DSP (FIR + Hilbert) with deterministic timing.  
> - Verified AM recovery (~500 Hz from 10 kHz carrier) and characterized SSB sideband suppression.  
> - Designed custom DE10-Lite <-> PMOD-I²S2 adapter PCB (DRC-clean, test points, silkscreen).    

### Dots & Boxes  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-black?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/junejinho620/dots-and-boxes) 
> Classic Dots & Boxes implemented in C on the DE1-SoC.  
**Tech:** `C` · `RISC-V Assembly`   
**Impact:**
> - Implemented classic Dots & Boxes on the DE1-SoC with C, drawing graphics directly to the VGA framebuffer.
> - Added keyboard controls (PS/2) with W/A/S/D navigation, line orientation toggle, and space/enter for moves.
> - Clean reset/restart flow with on-screen instructions.
